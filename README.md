# Neural_Networking_Chaerity_Analysis

## Project Overview 
  - Use neural networks with machine learning to create a model that can help predict whether applicants will be successful if the funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

-  Target variable for the model is anything that was successful.

-  Features variable for the model is “IS_SUCCESSFUL” column.

-  Variables that should be removed is “EIN” and “NAME” these columns added nothing of value.

- The numbers of neurons () layers () and activation functions () for completing the model.

- were we able to achieve the target performance for the model

- The step taken to increase the model performance is to add another hidden layer and keep testing.

## Summary
 -  We were able to get the accuracy to 72%. This needs to be high to make it more useful. As of right now we could miss companies that could really use the funding but due to a 28% of inaccuracy with thew model
